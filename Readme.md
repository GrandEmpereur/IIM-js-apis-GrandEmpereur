# IIM Project Javascript & Api spoonacular API


Welcome to the Happy Food project. This project consists in using an api on a website so that this api can interact with the different functionalities of the website.

#
## Explanation
#

the site is composed in 3 parts :
- 1 the left part is a navbar which allows us to have several searches according to the type of what we want to recover 

- 2 the central zone is there to have the result of the research that we made but also to have a search bar

- 3 The last part which is invisible because it is when we perform an action on the buttons read more we get the complete detail of the element that we have selected
